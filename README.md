Experimenting with background and animations in web

## The reason...
...I've made this project relies on my wish to make cool backgrounds with CSS.  

At first, I imagined a colorful background, but I only knew how to do it with `linear-gradient`, which wasn't giving me the expected result. Instead, I wanted to make some vibrant, colorful and expressive background.  Also, I always understimated `radial-gradient`s. 

While searching for ways to make my background, I found a beautiful art, but, unfortunately, I thought, it was copyrighted. 

Then, I knew the only thing I could do was to make the art myself with CSS: I learned `radial-gradient`s can be very useful along the way.
